HOW I MADE THIS PROJECT

This is a quick explanations of the decisions I made while working on this project.

INTRO

1) I haven't used MySQL, restify and Jest before this project. But restify was just a different expressJS, so lets exclude that.
2) I haven't really dig deep into the concept of microservices before.
3) I was working on 3 other "home works" from other companies, and I wanted to finish them ASAP. Why? I had first job interview a week ago, and I don't want to make the companies wait for a long time. I want to visit all the companies I have contacted within next few days, so I can make my decision and start working ASAP.
4) I made some last minute changes to make the code cleaner on some parts of the project, so there are some inconsistencies.
5) I hope this project won't be a huge pain to go through.

STARTING THE PROJECT

Ive never used github, since I was always developing localy and didnt need to colaborate with anyone. Although version control would come in handy. So I hope that it will work. My biggest worries are about the DB setup. In MongoDB I was used to MongoAtlas, but I could quicky implement any similar solution with MySQL.


ENDPOINTS

I wasnt really sure how to implement the endpoints, so I just used some random API's which I found on google and transformed the responses that I can work with them easily. I hope 3 will be enough.

MONITORING

The sentence "monitor endpoints on background" didn't tell me a lot, so I just implemented a solution that I used before, CronJobs. Hope they are somewhat similar to what have you expected.

AUTH

Well, I've came across authenticatio a few times, so I hope it KIND OF matches your expectations.

TESTING

I've never really tested API before. I just tested some basic JS functions. So I was kinda confused about that, plus I had to learn Jest. Im not really proud of the way the testing part of this mini project came out, but due to the time limitations I had, I hope you will understand a little.

SEEDING THE DATABASE

Well, MySQL was a new technology for me. I was used to MongoDB and mongoose. Im sure there is a way to avoind writing these queries, which look ugly to me. Or there is a better way to write the queries.

Also, removing database and then recreating it is probably a stupid idea, but I just couldnt make it work in any other way.


OUTRO
I was making some excuses about the new tech and the small time window I had to make this project. But well, thats my problem, so all excuses aside, this is the project I made. Even if you'd find my skills too low for Junior Dev at Applifting, i'd really apreciate if you'd find a few spare minutes to spit some ideas on how can I improve my code.
Hope you can stand my code, you will be the first experienced guys/girls to ever see my code {feeling nervous}!

With best regards,

Oskar
